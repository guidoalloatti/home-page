        IT leader with years of experience building effective teams and bringing the business vision to life.
        Whether it is adding high quality code, reviewing team member's code, running the day to day operations of the development group, planning out a strategy for automation with a technical team, or working with product management to figure out how to capitalize on an opportunity, I love being the bridge between technology and business. I believe in hiring highly skilled people, building fully cross functional teams, giving them a clear vision of their goals, and then getting out of their way.
